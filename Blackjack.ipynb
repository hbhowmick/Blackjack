    "2) Lose condition (someone busts) <br>\n",
    "3) OOP included (use of classes) <br>\n",
    "4) Ability to 'hit' or 'stay' during hand play <br>\n",
    "5) If the total is the same it's a 'push' (a tie where no one wins) <br>\n",
    "6) The game should continue to run until the user quits <br>\n",
    "7) Aces are worth 11 or 1 depending on total score, if there is an ace in the player's hand and they go over 21, then the ace becomes the value of 1 <br>\n",
    "8) Overall gameplay, dealer hits while under 17, higher score wins <br>\n",

    "1) Add currency <br>\n",
    "2) Multiplayer <br>\n",
    "3) Using real decks of cards (double for loop, one to create the suit, one to create the value of the card (store in tuple) <br>\n",
    "4) Adding the ability to 'double down' or 'split' <br>\n"
